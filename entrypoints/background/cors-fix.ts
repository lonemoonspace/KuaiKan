/**
 * @file cors-fix.ts
 * @description Universal CORS bypass for AI API requests made from the background service worker.
 *
 * ## The Problem
 *
 * Chrome extensions declare host permissions in the manifest (e.g. `<all_urls>`), but Chrome
 * also lets users override those permissions at runtime via the extension's context menu:
 *   "This extension can read and change site data" → "On all sites" | "On specific sites" | "On click"
 *
 * When a user switches from "On all sites" to "On specific sites", Chrome revokes the runtime
 * host permission for all non-listed origins — even though the manifest still declares `<all_urls>`.
 *
 * This has a critical side-effect on background service worker fetch() calls:
 *
 *   Chrome attaches an `Origin: chrome-extension://<id>` header to every outbound request.
 *   Third-party API servers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cerebras, Gemini, etc.) do not include
 *   `chrome-extension://` origins in their Access-Control-Allow-Origin policy, so the browser
 *   blocks the response (or the preflight OPTIONS) with:
 *
 *     "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
 *      No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
 *
 *   When site access IS "On all sites", Chrome exempts extension-initiated requests from CORS
 *   checks entirely (because the extension has host permission for those origins). That is why
 *   the extension works in that mode and fails in restricted mode.
 *
 * ## Why Removing `Origin` From the Request Does NOT Fix It
 *
 * An earlier version of this file used `declarativeNetRequest` to strip the `Origin` header
 * from outbound requests. That does NOT work.
 *
 * Chrome's network stack enforces CORS based on the *internal* request initiator origin, not
 * on the `Origin` header value present in the wire bytes. Even after the header is removed by
 * a declarativeNetRequest rule, Chrome still knows the request came from
 * `chrome-extension://<id>` and still checks the response for a matching
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Removing `Origin` from the request is a no-op from
 * CORS enforcement's perspective.
 *
 * ## The Actual Fix: Inject `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` Into the Response
 *
 * `declarativeNetRequest` can also modify *response* headers. By injecting
 *
 *   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: chrome-extension://<extensionId>
 *
 * into every response for requests that originated from this extension, we satisfy the
 * browser's CORS check. The browser compares the header value against the request's origin
 * and, finding a match, allows the response to be read by the extension code.
 *
 * We also inject `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to handle
 * preflight (OPTIONS) responses, which API servers typically send for POST requests with a
 * JSON body and custom headers such as `Authorization`.
 *
 * ## Why `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *` Is Safe Here
 *
 * The wildcard `*` for allowed headers is only forbidden when the request is made with
 * credentials (cookies, HTTP basic auth). Extension background fetches use API keys in the
 * `Authorization` header — this is not a CORS "credentialed" request — so the wildcard is
 * valid and avoids enumerating every possible header each AI SDK might send.
 *
 * ## Relationship to the Original Project
 *
 * The upstream project (reference/) solved a related but narrower problem for kimi.com by
 * rewriting the `origin` / `referer` request headers to the target domain. That approach works
 * for servers that do echo-back CORS (i.e., respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` matching
 * the received `Origin`) but fails for servers that hard-code their CORS allowlist.
 *
 * Injecting ACAO into the *response* works universally regardless of the server's CORS policy.
 *
 * ## Required Manifest Permissions
 *
 * `declarativeNetRequest` must be listed in the manifest `permissions`. It is added in
 * wxt.config.ts. This permission does NOT require user approval during installation.
